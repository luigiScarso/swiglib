"""
This project has the following objectives:

    Setting up an infrastructure for building libraries for LuaTeX using Swig so that we stay close to the original api's.

    Investigate libraries of different complexity. We also explore the impact of dependencies on other libraries.

    Provide a set of common helpers that can be integrated in libraries.

    Provide documentation on how to use this infrastructure and how to roll out your own.

    Come up with a naming scheme that makes it possible to avoid clashes between similar libraries. 
    In principle a user or macro package should be able to generate libraries independently of others and use these in a regular TeX setup.

    Make a couple of working examples of libraries, available for all major platforms.
